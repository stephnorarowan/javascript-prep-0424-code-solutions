## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
  1.) An optional name.
  2.) A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses.
  3.) The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace.
  4.) An optional return statement.
  5.) The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace
- How do you call a function?
  You write the name of the function and place parentheses next to it (with arguments in them).
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  A parameter is a placeholder. It is a variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass an argument. The parameter holds the value of the argument. When we define a function, we declare parameters and that when we call a function, we pass its arguments.
